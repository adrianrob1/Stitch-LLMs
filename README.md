The simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium-sized GPTs. It is a rewrite of [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) that prioritizes teeth over education. Still under active development, but currently the file `train.py` reproduces GPT-2 (124M) on OpenWebText, running on a single 8XA100 40GB node in about 4 days of training. The code itself is plain and readable: `train.py` is a ~300-line boilerplate training loop and `model.py` a ~300-line GPT model definition, which can optionally load the GPT-2 weights from OpenAI. That's it.

Because the code is so simple, it is very easy to hack to your needs, train new models from scratch, or finetune pretrained checkpoints (e.g. biggest one currently available as a starting point would be the GPT-2 1.3B model from OpenAI).

## install

Dependencies:

- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org) <3
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) <3
- `pip install transformers` for huggingface transformers <3 (to load GPT-2 checkpoints)
- `pip install datasets` for huggingface datasets <3 (if you want to download + preprocess OpenWebText)
- `pip install tiktoken` for OpenAI's fast BPE code <3
- `pip install wandb` for optional logging <3
- `pip install tqdm` <3

## quick start

### Train Forward
python3 ./train.py ./config/train_gpt2.py

## Train Backward
./train.py ./config/train_gpt2_backward.py

### Merge weights
python3 ./train.py ./config/train_gpt2_backward.py --resume_dir=out-gpt2-backward-5.2k --merge_dir=out-gpt2-forward-5.2k --wandb_run_name=gpt2-merge-test-10 --init_from=merge --eval_only=True

### Sample
python3 ./sample.py --out_dir=out-gpt2-backward
